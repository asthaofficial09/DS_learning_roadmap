# DS_learning_roadmap
A 12-week roadmap to strengthen my Data Science, ML, and Generative AI skills
# ðŸ“Š Data Science & AI Roadmap (12 Weeks)

This repository documents my **3-month structured learning plan** to sharpen my skills in **Data Science, Machine Learning, Big Data, and Generative AI**.

The goal is to:

* Strengthen fundamentals (Python, SQL, Statistics).
* Gain practical expertise in ML/Deep Learning.
* Explore Generative AI & LangChain for modern AI applications.
* Build projects & showcase work for job opportunities in Dubai and beyond.
